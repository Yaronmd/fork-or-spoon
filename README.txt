Fork or Spoon Image recognition.

The program identifies Spoon and Fork images, since the dataset mostly contains raw images of spoon/fork it will be more challenging for it to predict correctly when given low quality images that contain fork/spoon.


See requirements in requirements.txt file.

Instructions :

1.Run ForkOrSpoon.py 



ImageRecognizer.py - responsible of creating a model that is trained over the fork/spoon dataset, then it saves the model in order to use it on ForkOrSpoon.py.
